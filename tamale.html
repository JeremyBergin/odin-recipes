<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>

            <li>2lb pork shoulder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp lard</li>
            <li>red chile sauce</li>
            <li>masa</li>
            <li>1lb corn husks</li>
        <h4>Red Chile Sauce</h4>
            <li>10 guajillo peppers</li>
            <li>3 ancho peppers</li>
            <li>1/2 onion</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
        <h4>Masa</h4>
            <li>8 cups masa flour</li>
            <li>7 cups warm water</li>
            <li>2 cups lard</li>
            <li>2 tbsp baking powder</li>
            <li>3 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place corn husks in a large mixing bowl, large casserole dish, or in your sink and fill with hot water. Let the husks soak to soften while you prepare everything else.</li>
        <li>In a large dutch oven over medium heat at lard to melt or use preferred oil.</li>
        <li>Place pork in dutch oven and cook until cooked through and browned. You may need to do this in batches. Remove any liquid as it accumulates to ensure browned, crispy pork.*</li>
        <li>*Reserve any liquid/broth for the masa.</li>
        <h4>Red Chile Sauce</h4>
            <li>Place all ingredients, except salt, in a saucepan and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Let the contents cool for about 10 minutes and place everything in blender, including salt. Blend until smooth and salt more if needed.</li>
            <li>Add sauce to dutch oven with pork and let this simmer over medium low heat for 20 minutes.</li>
        <h4>Masa</h4>
            <li>Add masa flour to large mixing bowl and add baking powder and salt. Mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Add in melted lard and half of the water. Mix with your hands until thoroughly incorporated. At this point add any reserved, (and measured), broth from the pork and use more water if needed to complete the 7 cups of liquid.
            </li>
            <li>Mix with your hands thoroughly until you've made a masa that is smooth and spreads easily. If it is crumbly and dry, add a little more water. Try adding a tablespoon at a time. If it is too sticky add a tablespoon of masa flour. Try the masa and adjust salt as needed.</li>
        <h4>Assemble Tamales</h4>
            <li>Grab a corn husk, shake off water, and spread about 4 tablespoons of masa onto the smooth bottom part of the husk. You will spread this along the straight edge of the husk, not the pointed end. *The amount of masa you use will depend on the size of your husk. You want the masa to spread across the husk and leaving about Â¼ of an inch of the bottom of the husk without masa and only spreading it up to mid husk, spreading roughly into a 4 inch square or rectangle. Remember the masa needs to cover your filling.</li>
            <li>Add about 2 tablespoon of the pork filling. Fold over one side of the husk over and then fold the other side of the husk on top. This will make a cone-like shape. Fold over the pointed end of the husk over to seal the bottom of the tamale. You can choose to tie a piece of husk around the tamale to secure it but this is not necessary. *The amount of filling you use will depend on the amount of masa used.</li>
            <li>Add just enough water to steamer to cover the bottom but not spill over the insert. Cover the top of the insert with some corn husks to create a base/barrier between the water and tamales. Bring this water to a boil and then reduce heat.</li>
            <li>Arrange tamales onto steamer making sure they're all facing up. Cover with lid and increase heat to high to bring back to a boil. Leave the temperature at high for 20 minutes then reduce heat to medium.</li>
            <li>Finish steaming tamales at medium heat for additional 25-40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Test the tamales after 25 minutes on medium heat. If they don't separate from the husk easily, are still sticking to the husk, or the masa is still slightly raw and sticky, steam for additional 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, remove tamales from steamer and serve with chile and your favorite sides.</li>
